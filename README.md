**## Introduction:**

    * This repository contains the code and analysis for the IRIS Dataset Analysis and Classification project. The IRIS dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and is often used for classification tasks. In this project, we explore the dataset, perform data analysis, and implement three different classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.


**## Dependencies:**

    * Python (version X.X.X)
    * Jupyter Notebook (to run the .ipynb notebook)
    * Libraries:
         * Pandas
         * NumPy
         * Matplotlib
         * Seaborn
         * Scikit-learn



**## Usage:**

    * Open the Jupyter Notebook IRIS Dataset Analysis and Classification.ipynb to access the code and analysis. The notebook contains step-by-step explanations and code to perform the following tasks:

            * Data loading and exploration
            * Data visualization and analysis
            * Data preprocessing and feature engineering
            * Model training and evaluation using KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees
            * Model comparison and analysis of results
    * Simply run the notebook cells to follow along with the analysis and classification process.


**## Methods:**

    The following methods are implemented in this project:

       * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric classification algorithm that assigns labels to data points based on the majority class of their K-nearest neighbors.

       * Logistic Regression: A linear classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a data point belonging to a certain class.

       * Decision Trees: A tree-based classification algorithm that splits the data into subsets based on the values of features, aiming to create homogeneous groups.


**## Results:**

    The results of the classification models are presented in the Jupyter Notebook. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the models' effectiveness.
